Here is what I completed this week.

Setup:
- Use your previously implemented Facebook project. You can also download the sample implementation [here].
- Add the additional image assets above. Guide

Basic Layout and Transition
- In the Storyboard, add the 5 UIImageViews to the feed, remember to enable user interaction for each image view.
- Add tap gesture recognizers to each UIImageView.
- Create a PhotoViewController that has an image view embedded in a scroll view and a Done button.
- Create a modal segue from the FeedViewController to the PhotoViewController and give it a unique identifier.
- Attach an action to each gesture recognizer (they can be connected to the same action method). In the action, perform the segue. Guide: Performing Manual Segue.
- Set the image of the PhotoViewController. Guide:
